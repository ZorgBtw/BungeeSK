<h2 align="center">BungeeSK</h2> 
BungeeSK is a Skript addon that allows you to communicate with a bungeecord proxy easily !

<br>

## ðŸ“¥ How to download and install ?
You can download the last available version of BungeeSK by clicking [here](https://github.com/ZorgBtw/BungeeSK/releases/latest).
Then you can drop your `BungeeSK.jar` file in your Bungeecord `plugins/` folder and in every Spigot `plugins/` folder too. Make sure you got Skript running on your Spigot servers. (If not, you can download Skript [here](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases/latest))

## ðŸš€ How to run correctly BungeeSK ?
First, you will need to connect your Spigot servers (called as clients) to your Bungeecord proxy (call as server).
Here's an example of code to link everything:
```applescript
on server start:
	while client is not connected: # Using a while loop to try to connect if the client is not connected
		create new bungee connection: # Creation of a new Bungeecord connection
			set address of connection to "127.0.0.1" # Use this IP if the Bungeecord is on the same machine
			set port of connection to 20000 # This port as to be opened if the specified client is not hosted on the same machine as the server
			set password of connection to "Strong password" # Complete your password here, this has to be the same as the one in the Bungeecord config
		start new connection with last created connection # Sending connection request to the server
		wait 30 seconds # Waiting 30 seconds between 2 connection tries, it's recommended to not decrease this value
```
